- Have a `baseClass` file where predefined methods are already available.
- There are 4 ways we can run testcases with help of this framework. [To See detail here]()
  - With code
  - Without code
  - Separate JSON based BDD scripts
  - Excel based manual testcases
- There are 2 ways of storing locaters.

## Example for ways of writing Testcases for execution
### With Coding

### Separate JSON based BDD scripts
- These scripts are not programming based. Once created as said in [Overall Architecture](https://github.com/seeniforu/Python-Automation-Framework#overall-architecture-and-plan) it can be executed using other programming languages also.
